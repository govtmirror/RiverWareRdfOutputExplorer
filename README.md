# RiverWare RDF Output Explorer
This generates a dashboard to view, analyze, and query data from the [RiverWare(R)](http://www.riverware.org/) 
CRSS model outputs. This is primarily meant to support U.S. Bureau of Reclamation modeling and 
analysis efforts with the Colorado River Simulation System models. 

The dashboard is being developed in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and requires the installation of the following R libraries:
<BR>[shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
<BR>[shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html)
<BR>[shinyTree](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyTree)
<BR>[DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
<BR>[xts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html)
<BR>[zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html)
<BR>[RWDataPlot](https://github.com/rabutler/RWDataPlot)
